## Age-sex distribution

The age-sex distribution of France is given below. It is to be noted that all population counts are given in thousands and have been rounded off to the nearest integer.

```{r, echo=FALSE, comment=NA}
dat1985 <- read.csv("1985.csv")
dat2015 <- read.csv("2015.csv")
colnames(dat1985)<-c("Age_groups", "Males(1985)","Females(1985)")
colnames(dat2015)<-c("Males(2015)","Females(2015)","Age_groups")
final <- merge(dat1985,dat2015, by = "Age_groups", sort = FALSE)
x <- colnames(final)
x[1] <- "Age groups"
colnames(final) <- x
final
```



## Median Age

Year| Median Age (in years)
---|---
1985|33.6
2015|41.2

Thus, 50% of the French population in 1985 were below the age of 33.6 and the rest were of ages more than 33.6, whereas in 2015, 50% of the population were below the age of 41.2 and the others were of age more than 41.2. Thus, the median age of the French population has increased.

## Dependency Ratio

Total dependency ratio is the ratio of population aged 0-14 and 65+ per 100 population of the age group 15-64.					


Year| Dependency ratio
---|---
1985|51.8
2015|59.3

Thus, the total dependency ratio has increased in France in 2015 as compared to 1985.
